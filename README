<h3>README</h3>

<p>This README provides detailed instructions and information about various aspects of the project.</p>

<h4>Q1</h4>

<p>In Question 1, all runs and errors/failures are documented within the terminal. Additionally, core dumped files are provided, along with a screenshot of the opened DDD (Data Display Debugger) and GDB (GNU Debugger) inside the terminal.</p>

<h4>Q2</h4>

<p>A screenshot illustrating a successful run is attached. To execute, simply run the command:</p>
<pre><code>make all
./poisson x y
</code></pre>

<h4>Q3</h4>

<p>A screenshot demonstrating a successful run is provided. To execute, follow these steps:</p>
<pre><code>make all
./program
</code></pre>
<p>The hardcoded values from the assignment will be utilized as specified in Q2.</p>

<h4>Q4</h4>

<p>An attached <strong>gcov</strong> file is available, and its contents can also be viewed within the terminal at the conclusion of execution. To initiate:</p>
<pre><code>make all
./dijkstra (enter any amount of numbers with spaces between each number)
</code></pre>
<p>If numbers are entered, the program will proceed and prompt "Enter values for row x (expected y values):" for each row. To generate the gcov:</p>
<pre><code>gcov dijkstra.cpp
</code></pre>

<h4>Q5</h4>

<p>Nine files are attached, following the naming convention: <em>NameOfProg_Profiling_Number</em>, covering three programs and three sizes. This allows for the comparison of runtime occurrences for each.</p>

<h4>Q6</h4>

<p><em>This section intentionally left blank.</em></p>
