## Q1

In Question 1, all runs and errors/failures are documented within the terminal. Additionally, core dumped files are provided, along with a screenshot of the opened DDD (Data Display Debugger) and GDB (GNU Debugger) inside the terminal.

## Q2

A screenshot illustrating a successful run is attached. To execute, simply run the command:

make all ./poisson x y


## Q3

A screenshot demonstrating a successful run is provided. To execute, follow these steps:

make all ./program

The hardcoded values from the assignment will be utilized as specified in Q2.

## Q4

An attached **gcov** file is available, and its contents can also be viewed within the terminal at the conclusion of execution. To initiate:

make all ./dijkstra (enter any amount of numbers with spaces between each number)

If numbers are entered, the program will proceed and prompt "Enter values for row x (expected y values):" for each row. To generate the gcov:

gcov dijkstra.cpp


## Q5

Nine files are attached, following the naming convention: *NameOfProg_Profiling_Number*, covering three programs and three sizes. This allows for the comparison of runtime occurrences for each.

## Q6

*This section intentionally left blank.*
